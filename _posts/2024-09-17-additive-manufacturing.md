title: Additive manufacturing
subtitle: Swan offers additional design constraints to ensure manufacturability of designs

 Using Swan’s ﬂexibility, the manufacturability of the optimal designs can be guaranteed:

$$\nabla_x u = 0$$

- Usage of **perimeter** and **minimum-length-scale constraints** to avoid formation of small beams in the obtained solution
- Usage of **anisotropic perimeter** to limit the **overhang** of the solution for additive manufacturing

These designs are also easily exportable, making Swan the ideal toolbox to design your pieces and 3D-print them directly.
